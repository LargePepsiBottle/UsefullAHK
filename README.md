# UsefullAHK
A few AHK scripts that are i use for my own PC 
the ones in startup i have in shell:startup to auto run on login


**offonlock**
Purpose is to turn off screen automatically after pressing win+L due to now having an oled monitor and wanting to prevent burn in
Along with sometimes random programs and drivers prevent sleep so this 100% makes it sleep

**alwaysontop** 
2 functions, 1st sets window as always ontop with ctrl+alt+space,
2nd is Win+Numpad5 tries to move program to center of a 1440p screen and remove the title bar, essentially making it borderless
doesnt work very often but works sometimes

**autoclicking**
spamclicking on either left or right click every 50ms by holding the respective key, toggled on and off by pressing Win+Ctrl+rightclick or leftclick
